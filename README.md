# Webcontainer editor

Imagine the stackblitz editor (not codeflow) and you have this project.

## Why?

- The stackblitz editor uses a very outdated version of monaco-editor. The UI is also old and outdated.
- This project aims to bring the UI and the editor up to date.
- This project will also support custom themes and more settings.
